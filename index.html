        <div class="whee"><h3 id="ques"> IS COVID-19 WORSE THAN FLU?</h3>
        <p id="p">COVID-19 has a higher rate of severe disease and mortality in nearly every age group, compared with influenza (flu).
        It has killed more people in the US than flu has in the last five years,and 3.4 times as many people in 2020 than flu and pneumonia combined.</p>

        <div class="whee">
        <h3 id="ques">HOW EFFECTIVE ARE MASKS AND DO THEY ALSO NEED TO COVER MY NOSE?</h3>
        <p id="p">Mask wearing is a very simple and effective way to reduce transmission andsave lives.
        Masks alone are not enough to fully protect someone from the virus, but they still have an essential role to play in protecting high risk 
        individuals, such as frontline health care workers. For most people the greatest benefit lies not in protecting the wearer, but those around
        them. When combined with other safety measures like physical distancing and practicing good hygiene, they are a very effective tool with 
        little to no disruption to normal life.

        <div class="whee">
        <h3 id="ques">WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE HERD IMMUNITY WITHOUT VACCINES?</h3>
        <p id="p">Historically, the most successful way to achieve herd immunity is actually through mass vaccination. This is a much safer route as the 
        alternative is for roughly 60% of the population to be infected with COVID-19 which essentially means leaving the virus unchecked.
